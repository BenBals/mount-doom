## Build environment setup using nix

You can use nix to get your toolchain (compiler + cmake).

1. [Install nix](https://nixos.org/download.html).
2. [Setup nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).
3. Simply run `nix develop` to get a shell you can work in.

## Configure the build

1. `mkdir build && cd build` # create a build directory
2. `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..` # replace Debug with Release if you want -O3

- During configuration, your `CXX` environment variable should contain your compiler.
- All dependencies are dynamically fetched as sources by CMake.

## Compile the project

From inside the `build` directory, run ~make~.

## Run the tests

From inside the `build` directory, run ~ctest~.

## CLion

CLion's environment management is a hot steaming mess. We don't know all the answers yet. Here are some things that
worked for us:

- Start CLion from inside the nix shell
- Don't used the bundled CMake but create new 'toolchain' where you just put `cmake` as the path to CMake.
- Don't use Ninja. In the CMake settings, use the generator `Unix Makefiles` or set the CMake
  options `-G "Unix Makefiles"`.
- We use clang-format as formatter. CLion can automatically format according to the style guide. For this click on "4
  spaces" in the lower right corner and then click "Enable ClangFormat"

## MacOS

- Install boost manually (e.g. `brew install boost`).

# Formatting

- You can use the `scripts/format.sh` script to format everything in the project.
