Orodruin is a heuristic solver for directed feedback vertex set. It was created as part of Hasso Plattner Institute's participation of the [2022 PACE Challenge](https://pacechallenge.org/2022/).

We provide a theoretical [solver description](https://github.com/BenBals/mount-doom-description/raw/main/heuristic.pdf) and its [source code](https://github.com/BenBals/mount-doom-description).

## Build environment setup using nix

You can use nix to get your toolchain (compiler + cmake).

1. [Install nix](https://nixos.org/download.html).
2. [Setup nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).
3. Simply run `nix develop .#static` to get a shell you can work in. Alternatively, use `nix develop` to get an environment in which to build dynamic executables.

## Manual installation
You need a modern `gcc` and `cmake` and install the boost development libaries for your system (e.g. `boost-dev` on Apline).

## Configure the build
```shell
cmake -S . -B build-release-static -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDOOM_STATIC=ON
```

- Remove `-DDOOM_STATIC=ON` to build a dynamic executable
- All dependencies (except doom) are dynamically fetched as sources by CMake.

## Compile the project
Run  `cmake --build build -j4 --target doom`

## Run the solver
Pipe a graph in the [PACE input format](https://pacechallenge.org/2022/tracks/#input-format) into the process, e.g. `cat my_instance | doom`.
