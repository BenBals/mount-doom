# Mount Doom & Orodruin
This repo contains the code for the Mount Doom Solver for directed feedback
vertex set submitted to the [PACE challenge 2022](https://pacechallenge.org/2022/).

The exact solver Mount Doom can be found on the `exact` branch and its
heuristic sister Orodruin lives on the `heuristic` branch.

Both solvers are available under GPLv3.

You can find the [exact](https://github.com/BenBals/mount-doom-description/raw/main/exact.pdf) and [heuristic](https://github.com/BenBals/mount-doom-description/raw/main/heuristic.pdf) solver descriptions in their [github repo](https://github.com/BenBals/mount-doom-description).
